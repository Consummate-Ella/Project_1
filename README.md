Udemy Course Analysis Report

Welcome to the Udemy Course Analysis Report! 
This repository contains an in-depth analysis of Udemy’s subscription dataset, where we explored various aspects of course preferences, popularity, and performance. Whether you're a data enthusiast, an educator, or just curious about online learning trends, we hope you find our insights valuable!

Objectives
Our main goal was to derive actionable insights that can help understand what makes courses successful on Udemy. Here are the key questions we aimed to answer:
1.	Preferred Course Type: Are paid or free courses more popular?
2.	Top 5 Most Popular Courses: What are the top 5 courses by title?
3.	Subscriber Trends by Course Level: How does the course level affect the number of subscribers?
4.	Seasonality of Course Publication: When are the most courses published?
5.	Reviews by Subject: How do the number of reviews vary across different subjects?
6.	Subscribers by Course Level: Which levels have a higher number of subscribers?
7.	Revenue by Subject: How does revenue differ by subject?

Key Findings
•	Web Development Dominance: Courses in Web Development stood out as the most popular, attracting the highest number of subscribers and generating the most revenue.

Surprise Findings
•	Paid Courses vs. Free Courses: We found that paid courses generally have more subscribers than free ones. This may be linked to a higher number of reviews for paid courses, hinting at a positive correlation between reviews and subscriber preference. However, we note that the content of the reviews (positive or negative) wasn't analyzed, so this is a preliminary assumption.
